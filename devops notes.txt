After development
development-->release-->Development
operation
no downtime
handle huge traffic multiple request
--->OS
Communication between development and operation is DevOps

Waterfall----requirements-development-testing-operation


developed for Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS), 

ADV:
simple and easy to understand and use explicitly declared
Dis adv:
Cannot accept the changes in requirements during development.
Testing part takes more time 


EX:
Microsoft-->used waterfall model to develop Oracle


Agile:
speed of development, testing and deployment cycles
immediate feedback
fast development and deployment process
scrum and Kanban ?
CI/CD  continuous integration and Continuous Delivery  more efficient

GIT:
it is a version control tool
To share the code between developers etc.., 
Merge the changes automatically

public and private repositories



GIT repositories:
GitHub, Gitlab etc...,





commands:
to create new one
git. Add----add new file
git status ----status of git repository
gti commit----commit changes
git log -----history of changes
git push------pushed to local repository
clear

push old one to remote repo:
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/practice3261516/test-project.git----remote repository connection
git push --set-upstream origin master------Brach connection
rm-rf .git ----master node to normal node in prompt 


After installation of git:
git --version  ----> to know the version
git clone (URL)  ----> projects http URL----->connect without username and password URL method is used
clear  ----->just clears the text in the prompt
ssh-keygen



https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings ----add ssh (mine)
GitLab.com ----GitLab url
https://youtu.be/Vmt0V6a3ppE?si=Q6WuqOz5Yf0BXm1A   ---git setup video link
https://git-scm.com/downloads/win  ---->git install link





To speed up a code we are using DevOps
Agile is one of the methodology to deploy/develop a project----the flow
Version control system ----the changes were stored and maintained by the metadata  we can track them with the revised numberde4r
types of vcs:
local vcs ----- for single person usage (only one is going to create a project)
centralized vcs ----for multiple person usage (multiple person with the common server)---easy to merge the code
distributed vcs  -----every one have local vcs and all of them were connected to remote server ----multiple copy of repository


VCS Tool:
Git ---distributed vcs open source code
compatible for all OS



Work flow :
Working Directory-----working changes reflected here  ---after the git add command the file enters into the staging area
staging area-----to commit the changes  ----git commit command it will save into the local repository
local repository---committed  --- git push --- pushed to remote repository
working directory--staging area---local repository--remote repository
if we need in reverse order:
git fetch/pull from remote to local repository
git checkout or git merge from local to working area


Getlink:  https://git-scm.com/downloads

git config --global user.name "KANI"
git config --global user. Email "kani@gmail.com"

  
--global it is not required for local vcs 


cd source--- source is one of the project in our repo
ls ---list
pwd ---path folder

create new thing mkdir name  ---assign some name
in ls we will get that name
cd name ---name given in mkdir what we created
to come out from the folder cd ~
git in it folder name ---to initialize the project
touch filename ----create file inside the folder
ll -lrt to see all the files
ls -a 
ls is used to show the file names
ll -lrt is used to show the date, size permission with filename
vim file1 -----to add something inn file1
esc---> :wq ---> enter
after doing the changes give git add file1
git commit
git push
rm -rf .git ----> to get out from a git repository


creating a branches and working with the multiple developer can easy to merge the code without breaking the main branch

now i created a branch in GitLab

how will i access in git?
cd <project name>
git branch ---> to view the available branch
git pull -->branch name will visible
git checkout <branch name>
now directory will be changed
To create new branch :
git checkout -b <branch name>

to change the directory use git checkout main--->to main branch  same method for branches too

git push --set-upstream origin feature/dashboard-changes   ---->changes made by a branch that is pushed

in master branch for ci/cd pipeline

delete the branch go to master
 git pull
git branch -d branch name  ---> now deleted


if two person or more than two were using the same branch while git push it shows an error to avoid that use rebase git pull -r and see the history git log we can get to know the changes and now push the changes

to commit the changes we used to give some keywords to understand
git commit -m "keywords ......"
 


Merge conflicts:
if the changes were made in a same line we want to change that manually
after this then check the status using git status then do git rebase --continue and push it

add .Git ignore file 
to avoid the files that need not be shown in the GitLab/GitHub
inside the Git ignore file type like 
filename1/* --> name of the file
filename2/*

to stop tracking for a file use:
git rm -r --cached <filename>

stashing:
if i am doing some changes in one branch without committing that i am redirecting to some other directory it throws an error 
use git stash to store the changes somewhere 
to get back those changes use git stash pop

commit history:
every commit has a unique hash
git checkout <commithashcode> -->to get the old changes

locally i did some commit but i want to revert it back
git reset --hard HEAD~1  ---> number denotes how many commit from last to revert, head denotes last committed one


undoing and changing commit:
git commit -amend ---> we can get the last commit to edit

if it is pushed to remote repository but i want to revert it:
git push --force
git reset <commithashcode> -->to remove old commit

if it is in master branch
git revert <commithashid>  __> create new commit to remove old commit

to merge the code:
check the status of the master branch git pull is upto date or not
i am going to merge everything from master to some other directory --keep this directory in git and give command like
git merge master
check history and git pull



keyvalues database --everything is identified using keyvalue very fast but limited storage,no joins,schema less---> organized in a row format ex:redis, Kubernetes app used:twitter, snapchat  best for cache


wide column database:cassandra , apache hbase , handling large amount of unstructured data,no joins,schema less

document database:mongo db,dynamo db, couch db---> faster to read,schema less --> organized in document format
used for:mobile apps , game apps,cms

relational database:
MySQL, postgres
most used
schema required
stored in table format
normalized to avoid duplicates
ACID

graph database
ex:youtube
neo4j,dgrapg
nodes and edges
best for graphs and patterns

search databases
text search
elastic search,solr
ex:google

Build and package manager tool:
code needs to be be deployed in a production server, converting all the related files for a project into single file---> called as artifact

the artifact file format may differ depends on the programming language
for java it is saved/stored as jar or war file --->jar  java archive


installation tools
java,
maven (xml) or gradle (groovy) ---> build tool
node and npm 
IntelliJ --> platform to execute the code
in IntelliJ .pom file add configuration and in terminal mvn install
